# Topics

This folder contains topic-specific deep dives and organized learning notes.

## How to Organize

Create a separate folder for each major topic or technology you're studying:

```
topics/
├── react/
├── nodejs/
├── postgresql/
├── docker/
└── ...
```

Each topic folder can contain:
- Notes and summaries
- Code examples
- Best practices
- Common patterns
- Troubleshooting guides
