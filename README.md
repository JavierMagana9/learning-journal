# 📚 Learning Journal

Hi, I'm **Javi** – a MERN/PERN stack developer passionate about continuous learning and growth. This repository is my digital learning journal where I document my journey through new technologies, concepts, and best practices.

The purpose of this journal is to:
- Track my learning progress over time
- Reinforce concepts through written reflection
- Create a searchable reference for future projects
- Share knowledge with the developer community

## 🌱 What You'll Find

This journal contains:
- **Daily/Weekly Learning Entries**: Structured notes on what I'm learning
- **Topic Deep Dives**: In-depth exploration of specific technologies
- **Reflections**: Personal insights and "aha!" moments
- **Code Snippets**: Practical examples and experiments
- **Resource Collections**: Curated links to helpful articles, videos, and documentation

Each entry follows a consistent format (see [`template.md`](./template.md)) to maintain clarity and organization.

## 📅 Commit Philosophy

I believe in consistent, meaningful progress:

- **Regular Updates**: I commit learning entries as I complete them, not just when they're "perfect"
- **Honest Reflections**: This journal captures both successes and struggles
- **Iterative Improvement**: Entries may be updated as my understanding deepens
- **Clear Messages**: Commit messages describe what was learned or added
- **Growth Mindset**: Every entry represents a step forward in my journey
